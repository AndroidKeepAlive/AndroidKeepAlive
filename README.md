## Introduction

Is there still a viable keep-alive technology for Android in 2023? Yes! The strongest Android keep-alive solution shared here!

Unlike regular solutions like one-pixel or background music, this solution ensures that even if the user **force stops** the app, the **app cannot be killed**. It is based on Linux features and implements a set of **black-tech keep-alive technology**, pushing Android keep-alive to its limits. It ensures **eternal life** for the app. **Low power consumption**, no CPU usage, and theoretically, the keep-alive time can be **permanent** as long as it is not uninstalled. Even if the phone is turned off, it cannot be stopped!

Supports listing on Google Play (App Store).
